# LUMINA | Next-Gen Restaurant Operating System (Restaurant OS)

LUMINA is a next-generation fine dining platform that merges high-end atmospheric UI/UX design with startup-level business automation workflows. Built on the custom **Midnight Reserve** dark theme, it functions as a comprehensive Restaurant OS—combining customer-facing interfaces, interactive seat selections, AI sommeliers, and operational dashboards.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture & Features Overview

Lumina Restaurant OS is designed on a modular three-tier architecture:

```
[ Frontend Client ] ──( HTTPS / WebSockets )──► [ Express API Server ] ──( SQL Queries )──► [ PostgreSQL Database ]
   (Vercel SPA)                                     (Render Docker)                              (Supabase/Neon)
```

### Architectural Modules
1. **Frontend (FOH client)**: High-performance single-page architecture built with custom HSL theme variables, SVG seating maps, and reactive Canvas background particles.
2. **Backend (API Server)**: Node.js Express server routing table bookings, inventory reorders, and CRM search queries. Handles real-time progression push alerts using **Socket.io**.
3. **Database (Relational DDL)**: PostgreSQL schema managing tables, reservations, menu items, orders, CRM profiles, and time-series analytics.

## 🌌 Key Capabilities & Features

### 1. Customer Experience (FOH)
* **Atmospheric Vibe Selector Dial**: Allows guests to rotate and align the website menu, UI accents, and atmosphere with their evening's intent (*Seductive & Moody*, *Fresh & Energizing*, *Intimate & Romantic*, *Late-Night Social*).
* **Interactive Seating Map**: An interactive vector map showing real-time table configurations. Guests can click and book their exact dining zone (Window, Main Hall, Patio, Lounge).
* **AI Virtual Sommelier**: A reserve cellar chatbot assistant that suggests matching vintage wines in real-time based on active items in the cart.
* **Shopping Cart & Checkout Integration**: Fully responsive basket drawer with mock Stripe/UPI checkout integration.

### 2. Startup Business Operations (BOH)
* **Guest CRM Profile Lookup**: Allows managers to search guest profiles by name to retrieve previous visit counts, allergen alerts, and cellar preferences.
* **Smart Waitlist Allocation**: Seating table mapping with an AI automated assignment button that text-notifies guests via SMS when their table is ready.
* **AI Demand Forecasting**: Visual chart tracking hourly peak demand to automate inventory prep and staff scheduling.
* **Supply Chain Alert Engine**: Automated alerts notifying staff when high-value reserve stock (e.g. Alba White Truffles) runs low, with a one-click restock purchase trigger.
